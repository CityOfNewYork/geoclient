# Runtime environment variables

# NOTE:
#
#   Build arguments for Docker are set or defaulted in the build.sh file

# Docker environment file

# Source: https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/
#
#   When you set the same environment variable in multiple files,
#   hereâ€™s the priority used by Compose to choose which value to use:
#
#   1. Compose file
#   2. Shell environment variables
#   3. Environment file
#   4. Dockerfile
#   5. Variable is not defined
#
# NOTE:
#
#   Docker does NOT support variable substitution or other shell-like string
#   functions in .env files. E.g., use of single or double quotes will be
#   part of variable values if used.
