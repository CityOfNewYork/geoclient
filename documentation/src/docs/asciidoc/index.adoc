Geoclient is software which provides developer-friendly API's for geocoding New York City location information by proxying requests to Geosupport which is the City's official geocoder of record.

[NOTE]
====
Although, the names are similar, Geoclient and Geosupport are completely different systems built and maintained by two different teams:

* Geoclient (this project) is maintained as an Open Source Software project on {geoclient-repo}[GitHub].
* Geosupport is maintained by the {dcp-site}[Department of City Planning].
