== Concepts

This section describes the purpose and high-level design of this project.

'''

Once upon a time, the developers at the City of New York's OTI/GIS (formerly DoITT/DMI/GIS) found themselves repeatedly copying a fairly large amount of platform-specific Java/JNI and C client code between their own projects which depended on [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### for geocoding services.

[.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### was built to provide a simplified service API for interacting with [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### from any runtime capable of making simple HTTP GET requests. In other words, [.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### is just a proxy API for calling [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### which works dilligently behind the scenes doing the actual geocoding with its own data carefully researched and maintained by the Department of City Planning.

[.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### itself contains no additional spatial logic or reference data and by design tries only to make it easier for applications to call [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support###. The one exception is the /search endpoint which adds NYC location-aware, natural language parsing functionality appropriate for user-driven, "single-field search" e.g., via Ajax calls from an web page. See Section FIXME for details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although, the names are similar, [.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### and [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### are completely different applications built and maintained by two different teams:

* [.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### (this project) is maintained as an Open Source Software project on {geoclient-repo}[GitHub].
* [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### is maintained by the {dcp-site}[Department of City Planning].

It is important to understand that these are distinct software projects because [.geo]#Geo[.client]##client###'s primary purpose is to make it easier to use the [.geo]#Geo[.support]##support### geocoder. In this way, [.geo]#Geo[.client]##client### presents an intuitive, simplified facade but is not itself a geocoder.
