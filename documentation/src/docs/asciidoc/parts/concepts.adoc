== Concepts

This section describes the purpose and high-level design of this project.

'''

Once upon a time, the developers at DoITT/DMI/GIS found themselves repeatedly copying a fairly large amount of platform-specific Java/JNI and C client code between their own projects which depended on Geosupport for geocoding services.

Geoclient was built to provide a simplified service API for interacting with Geosupport from any runtime capable of making simple HTTP GET requests. In other words, Geoclient is just a proxy API for calling Geosupport which works dilligently behind the scenes doing the actual geocoding with its own data carefully researched and maintained by the Department of City Planning.

Geoclient itself contains no additional spatial logic or reference data and by design tries only to make it easier for applications to call Geosupport. The one exception is the /search endpoint which adds NYC location-aware, natural language parsing functionality appropriate for user-driven, "single-field search" e.g., via Ajax calls from an web page. See Section 1.3 for details.
